== Overview 
For customers who have their own JupyterHub clusters, there are two
options to integrate Teradata Jupyter extensions into the existing
clusters:

* Use Teradata Jupyter docker image
* Customize an existing Docker image to include Teradata extensions

This page contains detailed instructions on the two options.
Instructions are based on the assumption that the customer JupyterHub
deployment is based
on link:https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes].

=== Use Teradata Jupyter docker image

Teradata provides a ready-to-run Docker image that builds on the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/[jupyter/datascience-notebook] image. It bundles the Teradata SQL kernel, Teradata Python and R
libraries and drivers and Teradata extensions for Jupyter to make you
productive while interacting with Teradata database. The image also
contains sample notebooks that demonstrate how to use the SQL kernel,
extensions and Teradata libraries.

You can use this image in the following ways:

* Start a personal Jupyter Notebook server in a local Docker container
* Run JupyterLab servers for a team using JupyterHub

For instructions to start a personal JupyterLab server in a local Docker
container, please
see link:https://docs.teradata.com/r/KQLs1kPXZ02rGWaS9Ktoww/Fwvns7y_a7juDWx1NixC2A[installation guide]. This section will focus on how to use the  Teradata Jupyter
Docker image in a customer's existing JupyterHub environment.

*Download Teradata Jupyter Docker image*

Follow instructions on
https://downloads.teradata.com/download/tools/vantage-modules-for-jupyter[[.underline]#Vantage
Modules for Jupyter on Teradata Downloads#] to download the Docker
image. It is a tarball with name in this format
"teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION.tar.gz".

It is assumed that you have docker installed locally and have access to
the docker registry being used by the existing JupyterHub environment.

Run "docker load -i teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION.tar.gz" to load the
image locally and then run "docker push" to push it to a designated
docker registry.  You may want to consider changing the name of the
loaded image for simplicity.  Run "docker tag <old image name> <new
image name>" to modify the name.

*Use Teradata Jupyter Docker image in JupyterHub*

To use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image directly in your JupyterHub
cluster, modify the override file as described in
https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#choose-and-use-an-existing-docker-image[here
in the JupyterHub documentation]:
[source, bash, role="content-editable"]
----
singleuser:

image:

name: REGISTRY_URL/teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION

tag: latest
----

Replace REGISTRY_URL and VERSION with appropriate values from the step
above.

Apply the changes to the cluster as described
https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/extending-jupyterhub.html#applying-configuration-changes[here].

You can use multiple profiles to allow users to select which image they
want to use when they log in to JupyterHub. From detailed instructions
and examples on configuring multiple profiles, Please see
https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#using-multiple-profiles-to-let-users-select-their-environment[JupyterHub
documentation].

==== Customize Teradata Jupyter Docker image

If your users need some packages or notebooks that are not bundled in
the Teradata Jupyter Docker image, we recommend that you use Teradata
image as a base image and build a new one on top of it.

Here is an example Dockerfile that builds on top of Teradata image and
adds additional packages and notebooks:
[source, bash, role="content-editable"]
----
From REGISTRY_URL/teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION:latest

# install additional packages

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir astropy

# copy notebooks

COPY notebooks/. /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/DemoNotebooks/
----

Replace REGISTRY_URL and VERSION with appropriate values

Use the Dockerfile to build a new Docker image, push the image to a
designated registry, modify override file as shown above to use the new
image as singleuser image, apply the changes to the cluster as described
above.

=== Customize an existing Docker image to include Teradata extensions

If you prefer, you can include the Teradata SQL kernel and extensions
into into an existing image you are currently using.

Follow instructions on
https://downloads.teradata.com/download/tools/vantage-modules-for-jupyter[[.underline]#Vantage
Modules for Jupyter on Teradata Downloads#] to download the zipped
Teradata Jupyter extensions package bundle.  Assuming your existing
docker image is Linux based you will want to use the Linux version of
the download.  Otherwise, download for the platform you are using.  The
.zip file contains the Teradata SQL Kernel, extensions and sample
notebooks.

Unzip the bundle file to your working directory

Below is an example Dockerfile to add Teradata Jupyter extensions to
your existing Docker image
[source, bash, role="content-editable"]
----
From REGISTRY_URL/your-existing-image:tag

Use the new Dockerfile to build a new Docker image, push the image to a
designated registry, modify override file as shown above to use the new
image as singleuser image, apply the changes to the cluster.

You can optionally install Teradata package for Python and Teradata
package for R as well. For installation guide and sample scripts for
Teradata package for Python, please see
https://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/teradata-package-for-python-teradataml[information
here]. For installation guide and sample scripts for the Teradata
package for R, please see
https://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/teradata-package-for-r-tdplyr[information
here].  Installation steps can be added to the sample Dockerfile above.
